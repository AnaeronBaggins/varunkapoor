  abstract={Augmented reality acts as an add-on to teachers while teaching students, and this helps the teachers and students to have an interactive session. Augmented realityâ€™s usage in education is cited as one of the major changes in the educational sector. Thus, the work carried out makes a positive impact in the educational industry. Augmented reality provides features like image recogntion, motion tracking, facial recognition, plane detection, etc., to provide interactive sessions. Simultaneous localization and mapping and concurrent odometry and mapping have proved to be efficient algorithms for augmented reality on mobile devices. The work carried out allows students to view interactive newspapers while reading a specific article. It also allows them to view a dynamic three-dimensional model of the solar system on their smartphone using augmented reality.},

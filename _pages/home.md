### Welcome!

Augmented Reality(AR), Virtual Reality(VR) and, more recently, Mixed Reality(MR/XR) have been the forefront of radical change not only in the technical space, but also in the everyday lives of people. It is quickly becoming the most sought after skill for visualising consumer products as well simplifying development and manufacturing process in major companies.

Research in the field of AR, VR and MR will help us unravel the possibilties of these technologies, and with the base of ever-progressing image processing, AI and 3-D modelling methods, AR, VR and MR will take up a major role in every domain, from enterprise to open-source, from medical to architecture.

I believe that the progress of innovative technologies lies in it's implementation in inter-disciplinary fields, and that is what I aim to achieve.

### About me

I completed my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from Christ University in 2019, where I published a paper on Augmented Reality.
I started working in Mercedes-Benz Research and Development India (MBRDI) in 2019.
I moved internally to Daimler Truck Innovation Center India (DTICI) in 2021.
I am now looking to carry ahead my research in innovative technologies like AR, VR and MR.
